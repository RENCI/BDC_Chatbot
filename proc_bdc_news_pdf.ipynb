BioData Catalyst Powered by Seven Bridges **Archive files on AWS** Users on BioData Catalyst Powered by Seven Bridges can now select files to move from AWS S3 storage to AWS Glacier ([archival storage](https://sb-biodatacatalyst.readme.io/docs/file-archiving-overview)). Moving files to archival storage can result in an \\~80% cost reduction. **Estimate and Manage Cloud Costs on Seven Bridges** [Learn about](https://sb-biodatacatalyst.readme.io/docs/estimate-and-manage-your-cloud-costs) cloud storage costs and cloud computation costs as well as the primary drivers of those costs. Additionally, there is guidance on how to approach estimating costs to budget for cloud costs in grants, request cloud credits, and plan work on BioData Catalyst. BioData Catalyst Powered by Terra **Project Per Work Space (PPWS) Cost Reporting** Users on BioData Catalyst Powered by Terra will now have more transparency and access to cost information with the [rollout of PPWS](https://terra.bio/moving-to-a-project-per-workspace-model-for-improved-resource-management/).

These groups are:* Cross\\\\-Data Harmonization * CWL Development * GWAS/TOPMed For more information on these groups and for details on how to join the meetings, contact Amber at [alvoght@renci.org](mailto:alvoght@renci.org). | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | New Features and Release Highlights The following are release highlights from the Q3 release. For a full list of items from this release, see the [release notes](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/release-notes/2021-10-04-biodata-catalyst-ecosystem-release-notes) in our [documentation](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/). BioData Catalyst Powered by Seven Bridges **Archive files on AWS** Users on BioData Catalyst Powered by Seven Bridges can now select files to move from AWS S3 storage to AWS Glacier ([archival storage](https://sb-biodatacatalyst.readme.io/docs/file-archiving-overview)). Moving files to archival storage can result in an \\~80% cost reduction. **Estimate and Manage Cloud Costs on Seven Bridges** [Learn about](https://sb-biodatacatalyst.readme.io/docs/estimate-and-manage-your-cloud-costs) cloud storage costs and cloud computation costs as well as the primary drivers of those costs. Additionally, there is guidance on how to approach estimating costs to budget for cloud costs in grants, request cloud credits, and plan work on BioData Catalyst. BioData Catalyst Powered by Terra **Project Per Work Space (PPWS) Cost Reporting** Users on BioData Catalyst Powered by Terra will now have more transparency and access to cost information with the [rollout of PPWS](https://terra.bio/moving-to-a-project-per-workspace-model-for-improved-resource-management/). Switching to this “project\\\\-per\\\\-workspace” model enables added functionality for displaying a breakdown of costs per workspace in the Terra user interface, and allows users to [set up and use GCP budget alerts](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360057589931-How-to-set-up-and-use-GCP-budget-alerts) to be notified of cloud spending. **Understanding, Estimating \\& Controlling Costs on Terra** [Documentation](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360037862771-How-much-did-a-workflow-analysis-cost-#h_01F9F5M9M83QTN1R341P3XY5GT) is now available to estimate costs of workflows. [This article](https://support.terra.bio/hc/en-us/articles/360029748111) includes a detailed breakdown of the types of costs that you may incur when working on Google Cloud, plus some advice on how to reduce costs.

What is WDL? Two workflow languages are used in BDC, depending on the analysis platform you work on. Common Workflow Language Common Workflow Language (CWL) is a simple scripting language for describing computational workflows for performing sequential operations on data. CWL is a way to describe command\\\\-line tools and connect them together to create workflows. CWL is well suited for describing large\\\\-scale workflows in cluster, cloud, and high\\\\-performance computing environments where tasks are scheduled in parallel across many nodes. Workflow Description Language Workflow Description Language (WDL) is a way to specify data processing workflows with a human\\\\-readable and writable syntax. You can define complex analysis tasks, chain them together in workflows, and parallelize their execution. | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | | **Learn More:*** Learn how to create, test, and scale [CWL workflows](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/getting-started/community-tools-and-integration-1/bring-your-own-tool-s-to-biodata-catalyst/creating-testing-and-scaling-cwl-workflows) and [WDL workflows](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/getting-started/community-tools-and-integration-1/bring-your-own-tool-s-to-biodata-catalyst/creating-testing-and-scaling-wdl-workflows) in our [documentation](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/). * View the [full BDC glossary](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/community/bdc_glossary). * Register for our [February Community Hours](https://bit.ly/BDC-Feb) to learn about how to optimize your workflows, whether you are working with CWL or WDL. | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | \n",

Students (and instructors) may be short on the coding skills needed to get started in other environments but can start using BDC resources immediately. BDC offers code\\\\-forward and no\\\\-code informatics methods, and you will learn how to use both. This allows for focusing on teaching and learning the science rather than learning a new coding language. After your course, you and your students can still use BDC resources, and BDC can support their further skill acquisition by providing coding environments within the now\\\\-familiar BDC ecosystem.

Goodman, MSc, PhD, is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women’s Hospital at Harvard Medical School working on analyses integrating genomics, bioinformatics, and epidemiology. His research focuses on computational methods to analyze large\\\\-scale datasets and untangle the complex mechanisms underpinning sleep health and related conditions, including cardiovascular disease. | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | Dr. Goodman has an interest in utilizing recent methodological advancements in polygenic risk scores (PRS), along with functional genomics, to investigate gene\\\\-environment interactions (GxE) in the architecture of complex traits. He is actively developing gene\\\\- and pathway\\\\-specific PRS approaches that leverage large\\\\-scale genome\\\\-wide association study data and biological knowledge of regulatory function. As a TOPMed Fellow, his current research focuses on the role of sleep\\\\-related exposures as a modifying environment for genetic risk factors. Specifically, prior studies have seen both short and long sleep durations linked with hypertension, while single\\\\-variant GxE analyses indicate the capacity for sleep disturbances to disrupt biological pathways and modify the genetic risk of blood pressure dysregulation. A pathway\\\\-based approach has the potential to enhance both the detection and interpretation of these mechanisms. | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | **Why BDC?** *\"BDC not only facilitates efficient data analysis, but also fosters a collaborative research community and enhances distribution and adoption of methodological and analytical approaches.

[PIC\\\\-SURE Open Access](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/getting-started/explore-available-data/pic-sure-for-biodata-catalyst-user-guide/search-pic-sure-open-access) allows any user with NIH eRA Commons credentials to search any clinical variable in PIC\\\\-SURE. Open Access does not require dbGaP approval to access data, whereas PIC\\\\-SURE Authorized Access does. Because of this, the variables available for querying in Open Access are destigmatized, clinical variables and the results of the queries are aggregate participant counts. What is an example of using Open Access? To help illustrate the usefulness of Open Access, let’s consider a use case. If a researcher was trying to figure out which datasets to request access to for a project, they could use Open Access to build queries related to their research question and view aggregate counts to help figure out for which datasets to submit the data access request. | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | | **Learn More:*** View [documentation](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/getting-started/explore-available-data/pic-sure-for-biodata-catalyst-user-guide/search-pic-sure-open-access) about using PIC\\\\-SURE Open Access. | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | \n",

Previously, researchers were limited to searching data dictionary information on dbGaP and making comparisons between different study variables was cumbersome with poor UX. Study Variable Explorer enables researchers to select phenotypic variables from across TOPMed studies and view detailed information and distributions of the variable data. By searching keywords, such as obesity, a researcher can compare like variables within and across hosted datasets including the number of subjects and descriptions of the variables. Additionally, users can create custom searchable tags and notes for each variable to track their variable selection and pre\\\\-harmonization process. | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | [View Full Release Notes](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/release-notes/2022-07-11-biodata-catalyst-ecosystem-release-notes \"View Full Release Notes\") | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | Coming Soon A new PIC\\\\-SURE search interface *BioData Catalyst Powered by PIC\\\\-SURE* will be releasing an improved dynamic data exploration experience, allowing users to easily search and query at the variable and variant level. The streamlined search experience enables users to search variables and view associated information, such as decoded variable level metadata, details about the dataset, and study information \\\\- all without opening any data files. Some major updates to the search experience include:* Filtering search results by **variable** and **study tags** * New **genomic filtering** modal * Add **variables to export** without filtering * A simpler **select and package data** process * Visualize single **variable distributions** Stay tuned for release updates and [register for the September Community Hours](https://renci.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUqc-irpzMtHdG1O2OPKg3Nw3MTVLycRaJZ) which will demonstrate the new search and visualization features. | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | Researcher Spotlight | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | **Dr. Kira Bradford** | | --- | | Using BioData Catalyst to Advance the Development of Imaging and Deep Learning Approaches Dr. Kira Bradford recently served as the Science Lead for the RENCI team on the BioData Catalyst project and as a member of a research team led by Dr. Raúl San José Estépar, Director of the Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School. | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | As part of Dr. San José Estépar's team, Dr. Bradford contributed to the integration of the Chest Image Platform and showcased how BioData Catalyst could be used to advance the development of deep learning approaches in medicine by training neural networks in large datasets.

[PIC\\\\-SURE Open Access](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/getting-started/explore-available-data/pic-sure-for-biodata-catalyst-user-guide/search-pic-sure-open-access) allows any user with NIH eRA Commons credentials to search any clinical variable in PIC\\\\-SURE. Open Access does not require dbGaP approval to access data, whereas PIC\\\\-SURE Authorized Access does. Because of this, the variables available for querying in Open Access are destigmatized clinical variables and the results of the queries are aggregate participant counts. What is an example of using Open Access? If a researcher was trying to figure out which datasets to request access to for a project, they could use Open Access to build queries related to their research question and view aggregate counts to help figure out for which datasets to submit the data access request. | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | | **Learn More:*** View [documentation](https://bdcatalyst.gitbook.io/biodata-catalyst-documentation/written-documentation/getting-started/explore-available-data/pic-sure-for-biodata-catalyst-user-guide/search-pic-sure-open-access) about using PIC\\\\-SURE Open Access. | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | \n",

They show that this approach allows a more comprehensive characterization of genetic variations and can improve the genomic analyses used by a wide range of researchers and clinicians. | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | **Jean Monlong, University California Santa Cruz** | | --- | | **Why BioData Catalyst?** *\"Being a Fellow and being able to discuss with others that are doing some of the same things at the same time really helped me. If I had problems, I could talk to other people \\\\- the community is very cool. I would recommend BioData Catalyst, especially if researchers want to analyze datasets such as TOPMed. Without BioData Catalyst, this type of analysis can be a headache, but BioData Catalyst makes it so easy.\"* | | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | | **Learn More:*** View Dr. Monlong's professional biography as part of the [BioData Catalyst Fellows Cohort 1](https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/fellows/cohort1/) program. * View his professional [website](https://jmonlong.github.io/). * Register for the [April Community Hours](https://bit.ly/3qbItHX), where he will be discussing his research and experience using BioData Catalyst. | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | Events | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | Upcoming Events | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | April Community Hours: Community Showcase and Meet \\& Greet Join us on [**Wednesday, April 13th at 1 p.m. ET**](https://bit.ly/3qbItHX) for our **Community Showcase and Meet \\& Greet**.

FAIR stands for **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable**. These guiding principles were originally developed for scientific data management, but they have been expanded to guide the community in developing and sharing research methods, such as computational workflows, notebooks, and software. Below, you can learn how to leverage Dockstore and PIC\\\\-SURE to share your computational methods FAIR\\\\-ly. What is a FAIR workflow? Just like a piece of data, a workflow is a scientific object that needs to be managed. Dockstore, BioData Catalyst’s repository of reusable workflows, offers a suite of features that make it easy for researchers to share their computational methods as FAIR workflows. Why should your workflows be FAIR?* Easier to cite * Easier to get recognition for your work * Easier to reproduce results (both your own and others) * Collaborative nature of open\\\\-source software brought to bioinformatics * FAIR practices tend to be good software development practices Reproduce science using FAIR principles with PIC\\\\-SURE *BioData Catalyst Powered by PIC\\\\-SURE* allows users to perform variable and variant\\\\-level data search and participant\\\\-level data export. Users can utilize the PIC\\\\-SURE API in any preferred workspace to use python or R to query and analyze the data. The PIC\\\\-SURE API example code is available in the [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/Access-to-Data-using-PIC-SURE-API/tree/master/NHLBI_BioData_Catalyst). Additionally, users can use PIC\\\\-SURE Open Access to search any clinical variable in PIC\\\\-SURE, build cohorts, and retrieve aggregate counts regardless of their authorization to access data. | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | | **Learn More:*** Learn how to [make workflows FAIR](https://bdcatalyst.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/topics/60000406898) using Dockstore. * Learn about [conducting reproducible science](https://bdcatalyst.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/topics/60000406955) with PIC\\\\-SURE. | | --- | | | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | \n",
