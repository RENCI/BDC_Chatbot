BDC is also an NHLBI data repository where researchers share scientific data so they and others can reproduce findings and reuse data to advance science. The TOPMed Imputation Server, where researchers can upload their own phased or unphased GWAS genotypes and receive phased and imputed genomes in return, is also part of the BDC ecosystem.\n",

      "\n",
      "- 2018: NHLBI launched what is now known as NHLBI BioData Catalyst® (BDC), adding to its growing portfolio of data science activities. Early on, BDC recognized the importance of gathering external experts and formed the External Expert Panel (EEP).\n",
      "\n",
      "- 2019: BDC formally adopted its name and aligned its branding to NHLBI, making it recognizable as an Institute project and elevating its visibility among the research community.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 2020: BDC welcomed its first and second of three total cohorts of fellows to the NHLBI BioData Catalyst Fellows Program. BDC supported over 45 early-career researchers conducting research on novel and innovative data science and data-focused research problems while also benefiting from their feedback on improving the ecosystem and its users' experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 2021: BDC welcomed all researchers [by inviting them to join the community](/latest-updates/NHLBI-BioData-Catalyst-welcomes-all-researchers) and use the ecosystem to access and analyze data. First among the data hosted by BDC was [NHLBI's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed)](https://topmed.nhlbi.nih.gov/), which included data from over 85 studies and around 180,000 participants. In this same year, BDC also graduated its third cohort of fellows.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 2022: NHLBI expanded the BDC infrastructure by adding the BDC Data Management Core to help ingest data and offer informational resources about using BDC as a data repository.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 2023: [NIH's Data Management and Sharing (DMS) Policy](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-013.html) went into effect on January 25th, and on May 25th, the [NHLBI Supplement to the NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/policies-and-guidelines/nhlbi-policy-for-data-sharing) went into effect. The Supplement \"encourages submission of data into [NHLBI BioData Catalyst (BDC)](/), especially for data from studies that must comply with [NHLBI's Accrual of Human Subjects (Milestones) Policy](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/policies-and-guidelines/accrual-of-human-subjects-milestones-policy) and for those projects supported by funding opportunity announcements that encourage data deposition into BDC.

      "All BioLINCC data and biospecimen are de-identified (obvious subject identifiers have been redacted); however, they contain such a wealth of individual data that there may be a possibility of determining identity. Therefore, BioLINCC operates under an NIH IRB-reviewed protocol, which requires that datasets may only be released to researchers who are themselves under the oversight of an IRB. In BioLINCC, most of the studies have datasets only; some have both study datasets and biospecimens, and others have biospecimens with limited vial characterization data but not complete study datasets.\n",

While C4R is one of many efforts investigating the effects of COVID-19, it is unique in that the participants were being followed prior to COVID-19 and have undergone multiple detailed health assessments. The goal of C4R is to improve understanding of what factors increase or decrease the likelihood of developing severe COVID-19 or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC).
